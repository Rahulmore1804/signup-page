if you want work on same project for differance experiment then make two branch of same project. and if experment 
goes success  we can merge

to make branch 
"git branch justmakingbranck"

to see all branch " git branch"

to switch branch "git checkout <alredy made branch name>"

to merge branch "git merge <name of branch you want to merge>

all new folders and new text will seperate in branch

we can also do same on github web there is option of branch and commit
